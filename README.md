# 🕹️ Game Boy WiFi Link Bridge (DMG-01 + ESP32)

**Wireless Game Link for original Game Boy DMG-01 consoles.**  
Bridge two classic Game Boys over WiFi using two ESP32 boards and a bi-directional level shifter. The project reproduces the Game Link serial protocol (clocked, synchronous) across a WiFi link so both consoles behave as if connected by a physical cable.

---

## Short description

This project replaces the Game Link cable with a wireless bridge: each Game Boy connects to an ESP32 through a level shifter (5V ↔ 3.3V). One ESP32 acts as **Server (AP)** and the other as **Client**; serial frames captured from one GB are transmitted over UDP and reconstructed on the other side, preserving timing and master/slave behavior.

## Top-level diagram (ASCII)
- HV = high-voltage side of level shifter (Game Boy 5V side) - green wire
- LV = low-voltage side of level shifter (ESP32 3.3V side) - brown wire
- GND = Ground - black wire
- SO = Serial Out (Game Boy → bridge) - orange wire
- SI = Serial In  (Game Boy ← bridge) - yellow wire
- SC = Serial Clock (generated by the Game Boy configured as master) - blue wire

### 🧰 Required Components
- 2 × Nintendo Game Boy **DMG-01** (“the brick” model)  
- 2 × **ESP32** boards (DOIT ESP32 Devkit V1 recommended)  
- 1 × **Bi-directional Level Shifter** (5 V ↔ 3.3 V)  
- Standard wiring for **SI / SO / SCK / GND** lines

## 💾 Software Components

### ⚙️ ESP32 Code
- **Server** – Acts as the main WiFi access point, manages synchronization and relays serial data between consoles.  
- **Client** – Connects to the server via WiFi and mirrors the Game Link communication on the second Game Boy.

### 🎮 Game Boy Code
- **Server ROM** – Sends button states and data through the link port (master mode).  
- **Client ROM** – Receives and processes data from the ESP32 link (slave mode).  
Both ROMs are written in **C (GBDK)** and designed to display button input and link status on-screen.

## 📡 How It Works

1. Each ESP32 is connected to a Game Boy’s Game Link port via a level shifter.  
2. The **server ESP32** creates a WiFi network; the **client ESP32** connects to it.  
3. Serial data from one Game Boy is read bit-by-bit (synchronized by the Game Link clock), transmitted over WiFi, and reproduced on the opposite ESP32.  
4. The system allows **real-time bidirectional communication** between two Game Boys wirelessly.

## 🧠 Technical Notes

- Communication timing follows the original **Game Link protocol (~512 kHz clock)**.  
- Both consoles must share a **common ground** through the level shifters and ESP32 boards.  
- All transfers are **fully synchronous**, respecting the Game Boy’s master/slave SPI-like behavior.  
- Can be adapted for other link-based applications such as **multiplayer games, debugging, or data exchange**.

## 🚀 Current Status

✅ Working prototype: button transfer and bidirectional communication tested.  
🧩 Next steps: latency optimization and full multiplayer game testing.

## 💡 Project Motivation & Credits

This project was created out of curiosity and passion for classic hardware — to **modernize the iconic Game Link cable** using contemporary IoT technology while preserving the authentic behavior of the original Game Boy hardware.  

Developed and tested on real **DMG-01 units** with **ESP32 Devkit boards** and custom C code written for both sides of the link.  

🧠 Special thanks to the **retro-hardware community** for their resources and documentation on the Game Boy serial protocol.
